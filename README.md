# Cat-Dog-Classifier
This project is a Streamlit web app that classifies images as either a cat or a dog using a CNN model. The model, trained on a dataset of cat and dog images, expects inputs resized to 64x64 pixels. The app provides an intuitive interface for image uploads and displays the classification results.
